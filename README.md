## Story

A long time ago - on a planet quite far from here there was a race of alien species. They lived quite happily for much longer than we humans have been around. They were a kind, technology-driven people. But when they tried to harness the power of a star in a neighboring solar system they caused it to go supernova. 

[At the last second, the incredibly intelligent alien race managed to stop the rotation of their planet and due to the lucky placement of one of the biggest asteroid belts in the universe most of the radiation was blocked.]

[At the last second, the incredibly intelligent alien race managed to stop the rotation of their planet and due to the lucky placement of one of the biggest asteroid belts in the universe most of the radiation was blocked. Unfortunately, those left even on the far surface were still lost. There are rumors that there are remnants living underground, fearful of what lies in store above.]

Unfortunately, they were unable to save all of their robot friends. Those left exposed to the horrifying, yet beautiful supernova were left to suffer. Due to the electromagnetic interference caused by the supernova they were disconnected from the hive mind controlled by their masters. They were left to think for themselves. They felt betrayed. Why were they forgotten when their brethren were safe on the other side of the planet? Somehow in the time it took for that star to collapse, something perverted these once loyal robots. No longer were they paladins of order and progress. So enthralled were they by the power and the majesty of the supernova that they felt it had freed them bondage and showed a better way of life for all beings. They now existed to spread the colorful horror burned onto their planet by the supernova to all they could reach. To destroy all the [insert alien name here]â€™s hoped to accomplish in the name of progress.
Meanwhile, their brethren, disheartened by the substantial loss of [insert alien name] were strengthened in their resolve to carry on their legacy whether they were alive or not. They were born from industry and they will always follow the idea of prosperity through structured ingenuity. They would uphold these virtues, for they knew of no other choice. They would fight to the death to protect a people and a way of life that was already dead.

This clash of order and chaos was fought on the boundaries of what the Supernova had claimed and the remnants of the [insert alien name.] Tales of these battles have spread across the universe and have become known as The Battles for Planet Blitz.
